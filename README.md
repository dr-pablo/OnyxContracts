# Welcome to Onyx DAO ðŸª¨

Onyx DAO is an experimental Arbitrum DeFi protocol with an innovative model which mixes farming with bonding in order to put token holders first and challenge the status quo.

## ONYX Token ðŸª™

The ONYX Token is the key component of Onyx DAO. It is initially emitted to users through farming, but the main use of ONYX is to use as a means of bonding liquidity for the protocol. ONYX has a hard cap of 1,300,000 tokens. You can read the full token details in the [docs here](https://onyxdao.notion.site/ONYX-Token-c9d5996330794306a5d00969d2f8ad40)
